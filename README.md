Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

The file *run_analysis.R* is a R script containing all the five steps requested by the *Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project*.
Please refer to the link for more details about the project: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-007/human_grading/view/courses/972585/assessments/3/submissions.
All steps are explicity indicated with a notation '## SCRIPT' and  have to be run in sequence from 1 to 5. The tasks performed in each step are generally commented for sake of clarity.
The last teo lines in the script was kept as a comment and can be used first to write the result into a .txt file in the working directory and then to view it.

The file *CodeBook.md* is a detailed description of the variables in the code in relation to the assignment. In order to be fully understandable it requires a previous reading of the files included in the original data set, in particular README.txt and feature_info.txt.
